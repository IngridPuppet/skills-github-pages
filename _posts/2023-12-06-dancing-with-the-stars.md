In the velvet sky where dreams unfold,
A cosmic waltz, a tale untold.
Stars adorned in sequined light,
Dancing through the vast expanse of night.

Their pirouettes, a celestial ballet,
Each twinkle, a step in the cosmic array.
With grace, they sweep across the dark,
Igniting galaxies with a radiant spark.

Moonbeams join the splendid trance,
Casting shadows in a cosmic dance.
Constellations, partners in the night,
Whirl and twirl in soft moonlight.

Eclipses weave a rhythmic scheme,
A cosmic tango, a stellar dream.
Through galaxies and cosmic memoirs,
We waltz, enchanted, with dancing stars.

So let's embrace the cosmic tide,
In this celestial ballroom, side by side.
Beneath the astral shimmer afar,
Forever entwined, dancing with stars.
